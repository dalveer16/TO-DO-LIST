# TO-DO-LIST
The project titled as “To-Do List “is a web based application. To-Do List are prioritized lists of all the tasks that you need to carry out. By keeping such a list, you make sure that your tasks are written down all in one place so you don't forget anything important. One of the most important reasons for keeping a to-do list is the organization. Organizing your tasks with a list can make everything much more manageable and make you feel grounded. The system will maintain information about various users who will be able to access the system. Software provides facility for quick add (lets you capture and organize tasks in seconds), task view (gives you complete picture of any task), delete task (to free up your mental space).
